# Movie-Recommendation-System
Movie recommendation systems are algorithms designed to suggest films tailored to users' tastes and behaviors. They analyze data like viewing history, ratings, and movie attributes using techniques such as content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid methods. Frequently trained on datasets like MovieLens, these systems personalize recommendations to improve user satisfaction. Popular platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime use such tools to enhance the entertainment discovery experience.
